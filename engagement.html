                        <strong>GETTING ENGAGED</strong>

                        Dance is an all age activity, and it is possible to get engaged to dance no matter how old you are. However, some dance studios and groups are adult or minor only. Generally, a typical dance studio will have at least one or two classes that are geared towards adults while most of their offered classes are for minors from ages three to eighteen. These adult only classes are generally not for the more advanced, but simply adults that want a new way of getting physically active. Those that are more advanced, even at the adult age, can get engaged at an adult only dance studio, dance conventions, online dance tutorials, and local dance groups.

                            With the rise of the internet and ever-increasing use of social media, getting engaged has only gotten easier. There are countless teachers, dance groups, and communities to get engaged with online. Larger organizations sell tutorials through a subscription process. Independent choreographers and teachers will sell content via a streaming service. They may also have their own website where you can sign up for personal training virtually. Other choreographers and teachers will have a YouTube channel where they post their content for free. Some dancers prefer to live on Instagram, of which you can find many little tutorials, tips, tricks. Some dancers take their engagement to TikTok and reach that audience, although tutorials do tend to be shorter and of less quality on that platform.

                            Those that are looking to dance pre-professionally/professionally can join a local competitive dance studio. Competitive studios travel locally/nationally to compete against other dance studios. The environment is more competitive and participating dancers usally take it more seriously. Many have kickstarted their professional career this way. Unique opportunities can come  from monetary scholarships and masterclass invitations that are awarded at conventions. Others come from performance teams that consist of individually selected dancers chosen by the company. Selected dancers get the opportunity to work closely with lead choreographers that put together a performance during nationals. Occasionally, a dancer will get selected by a talent scout and be given an opportunity to audition for agent representation. Another career kickstarter can come from being selected to work as a teacher's assistants through the touring year.
